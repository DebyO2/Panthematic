# Panthematic
I made the game in unity and u can download the game from https://debyo2.itch.io/panthematic and remember to be on windows , i asked a friend to test it in linux but it has some bugs in linux with fonts so use windows if possible 


i have used these technilogies in my gamedev journey:
    
    (1) Unity
    (2) Blender
    (3) visual studios for c#
    (4) audacity
    (5) gimp
