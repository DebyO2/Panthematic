# Panthematic
I made the game in unity and u can download the game from https://debyo2.itch.io/panthematic and remember to be on windows , i asked a friend to test it in linux but it has some bugs in linux with fonts so use windows if possible 


i have used these technilogies in my gamedev journey:
    
    (1) Unity
    (2) Blender
    (3) visual studios for c#
    (4) audacity
    (5) gimp



## Installation

Install it from itch to play or if u want to see the source code u can see it at top(all files not included and some files are assets which are like packages in python)

```bash
  1.Download the game from itch.io from this link https://debyo2.itch.io/panthematic
  2.Run the executable 
```


## Notes

 - The source code does not include all the necessery files to use in unity , it only contains the scripts and other files like packages , metarials , fonts, etc are not here because of storage problems so u can just see the scripts
 - please if you want full game juice and higher FPS then please download the game instead of webGL because it will reduce the performance and some features
 - i have used assets in unity (Like the Quick outline asset) which are like packages in python so i think they cannot be counted as pre existing code
